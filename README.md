# Handwritten vs Printed text images classification
### A comparison of these three models
- Custom CNN Model
- Transfer Learning Model
- Transformer LLM

We have a dataset of printed text images and handwritten text images. We have to build a classification model which will take an image and will tell whether i has handwritten or printed text on it. Basically we have build three models to compare their accuracy and prediction results.

- ***pip install -r requirements.txt***

- After environment setup completetion run this command to interact with the streamlit app
- ***streamlit run app.py***
